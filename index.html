                <p>I am a proud mother of 2 who is a hard working creative thinker. I have a bachelor's degree in Commerce
                    and accounting. I am passionate about arts and I teach kids Indian classical dance. Lastly, I am driven
                    by my desire to make a difference in peopleâ€™s lives. In terms of where I am in my professional life,
                    I haven't worked full time in over 10 years due to various different reasons. Initially it was because
                    of my visa restrictions and later it was because I wanted to stay home with the kids. Now, I want to
                    have a career instead of just a job and I was looking for a structured course to help me get into the
                    IT industry. Here we are. :).
